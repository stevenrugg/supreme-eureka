# [Dcoder](https://dcoder.tech) Solutions

Dcoder is a website and mobile application (for iOS and Android) that provide a REPL of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6). Also found on the site are world problems similar to what you would see on sites such as [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) or [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com).

## Python3 problems

1. INPUT: two integers A and B, a list of integers C
   OUTPUT: a list of integers lst
   1a. First integer of input is length of list comprehension, second is target integer.
   1b. Create a list comprehension with correct length using space seperated integers from input C.
   1c. Use a for loop to iterate through, adding all the items matching target integer to return list lst.

```python
A = int(input())
B = int(input())

nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(" ")]
lst = []
for elem in nums:
    if nums[elem] == B:
        lst.append(nums[elem])
print(lst)
```
