The typing animation of the home page of this blog was made using `react-typical`, a typing animation react component
provided by `npm`.

## Installing react-typical

Inside the root folder of your project open a terminal and type the following command:

```shell
npm install react-typical 
```
If you're having issues installing the package try using either using the `--unsafe-perm` or `--legacy-peer-deps` flags.
In the components folder of your application or equivalent, its time to 
make a Typical component. Create a new react function component like
```javascript
const Typical = props => {
    return (
  // typical logic here
    )
}
export default Typical
```
Typical uses thre parameters when caling the `Typical()` method. 
- `steps`
- `loop`
- `wrapper`

They are called in order as follows

```javascript

const Typical = props => {
  return (
    // steps in an object with one list, after each word is an integer controlling the typing speed in ms.
    steps={['WordOne', 1000, 'WordTwo', 1000, 'WordThree', 500]}
    // Infinity or number of loops up to 2500
    loop={Infinity}
    // wrapper the method will use in the resulting html. Choices are H1-6, SPAN or P
    wrapper='h1'
  )
}
export default Typical
```
The result is a pretty slick typing animation that looks really cool. You can find the npm Typical package
[here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typical).
