# Welcome to the blog! 

This is a new blog and I will be adding articles as I write them. This blog is made with TailwindCSS, Next.js, MDX and Typical. I have templated my blog from the [TailwindCSS Next.js Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) and added my own spice, including a guestbook, custom CSS gradients, logo & MDX enhancements. 

## What Does the Future Hold?

I expect I will blog about all the new projects I create in my software development career. Right now that career is in its infancy. I will try my very best to share my technology, and express myself with it. One never knows, I could be the next Bill Gates. Fat chance, but then again... you never know when you'll come up with a billion dollar idea!
